Summary - 

~ Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying distribution of dataset and relationship between the variables.

~ It includes analyzing the variables, missing value handling, encoding the categorical variables, feature scaling and handling the imbalanced data. 

~ Built predictive models to classify whether the person is having risk of CHD in future, using various machine learning algorithms and evaluated each model's performance using the error metrics.
